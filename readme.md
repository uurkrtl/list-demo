## Coding: Students in List

Create a new project in IntelliJ and lay the foundation for the Java List project.

-   Step 1: Create a Java class "Student" that should have the following properties: First name, Last name, Student ID.
-   Step 2: Create a Java List for elements of type "Student" and add multiple students.

Abstraction using object-oriented techniques.

-   Step 3: Create a class "School" to which students can be added through a method ('addStudent').
-   Step 4: Implement a method to print all students of the school (as text, to the console).

Algorithms with lists.

-   Step 5: Add a method to find a student by their ID. The found student should be returned.
-   Step 6: Create a method to remove a student from the school.
-   If you have already completed this task earlier, you may work on the bonus task on the next page.

If you have already completed the main task, you can try this bonus task.

-   Expand the Java-List project with a class called "Course" that has the following properties: course name, instructor, room.
-   Add a method to the Student class to add courses to the student (courses in which the student is participating).
-   Implement a method within the School class to retrieve all courses of a specific student (based on a student ID).

Are you so fast?

-   Write a class 'Sack' that functions like an ArrayList. It can only use primitive data types and arrays.
-   Implement step by step the methods add, get, size, remove last, remove by index, and so on.

Are you so fast???

-   Write a class 'Beutel' that functions like the 'Sack', but only uses primitive data types (no arrays!!!).
-   Again, implement step by step the methods add, get, size, remove last, remove by index, and so on.
